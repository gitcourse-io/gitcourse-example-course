Flink runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. To be able to run Flink, the only requirement is to have a working Java 8.x installation. Windows users, please take a look at the Flink on Windows guide which describes how to run Flink on Windows for local setups.

You can check the correct installation of Java by issuing the following command:
```
java -version
```
